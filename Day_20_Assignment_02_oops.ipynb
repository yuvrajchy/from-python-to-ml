        "- Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after another. This works because each method returns the object itself (self), which allows the next method to be called directly. It makes the code more compact and readable. Method chaining is commonly used in object-oriented programming when we want to perform a sequence of operations on the same object without writing multiple separate statements.\n"

        "- The __call__ method in Python allows an object of a class to be called like a function. When this method is defined inside a class, it is automatically executed whenever the object is followed by parentheses. This makes the object behave like a function while still being an instance of a class. The main purpose of __call__ is to add function-like behavior to objects, which can be useful in cases like creating function wrappers, decorators, or when designing classes that need to be invoked multiple times with different arguments."
